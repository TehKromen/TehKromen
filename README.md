## 👨‍💻 Backend Developer | Java & Spring Boot

I’m a backend developer focused on building scalable, maintainable, and well-structured applications using Java and Spring Boot. I build backend systems using hexagonal architecture to ensure modularity and maintainability. I’ve occasionally worked with Kafka for messaging needs and use Angular when frontend development is required.

I enjoy designing APIs, modeling real-world domains, and delivering solutions that balance performance with clarity. Always curious, always learning — especially when it comes to clean code and system design.
